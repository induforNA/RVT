# Rural Valuation Tool
_Developed by [Indufor North America](www.indufor-na.com), Foundation for Ecological Security and Ulster University_

_Funded by Omidyar Network_

Indufor North America partnered with the Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) and Ulster University to develop a rural valuation tool (RVT) for use by households, communities, the investment community, and government. Omidyar Network provided support to the project. The tool is intended to help stakeholders calculate the estimated value of rural lands and natural resources, particularly in environments where there is little data on comparable land sales. The tool integrates market and non-market methods to produce primarily quantitative data, and captures both social capital and natural capital in diverse settings. Indufor developed an Excel version of the valuation tool, as well as an Android-compatible mobile application of the tool for easier in-field entry. Drawing on principles of natural capital accounting, social capital accounting and real property rights, the valuation model considers a broad range of benefits generated by both communally-held and private property. One of the unique contributions of this initiative is to synthesize evidence of the role that different property rights and levels of social capital have on the ability of stakeholders to use and manage natural resources and ecosystem services over time. Future phases of this initiative may seek to automate certain aspects of data capture and analysis to facilitate a more efficient and cost effective way of estimating the value of community assets, for example using a variation on computer-assisted mass appraisal.

The code underlying the Android app version of the Rural Valuation Tool is available here on [Github](https://github.com/induforNA/RVT).
